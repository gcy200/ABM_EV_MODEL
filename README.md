ABM Project Group 1 EV's

To make the visualization work, you have to have the EV folder + the run.py file. The run.py file imports from the EV folder and launches the server. 

To run, enter in  a terminal window, while you are at the location of both run.py and the EV folder: python run.py

For the analysis part, you can use the jupyter notebook file run.py.ipynb, which basically has the same contents as the run.py file, but with the batchrunner. For visualization I (Jerome) thought this was easiest.
